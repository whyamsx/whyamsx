I am developing the [**Gang**](https://github.com/whyamsx/gang) project, I hope in the future it will become popular among young people and at the same time give me new knowledge in many areas of programming.

The main stack that I will use in the future is `Go` and `React Native`. \
Further, the project will be developed by me alone and in open source form.

I wish myself the best in my big endeavors!
